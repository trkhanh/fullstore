The templates directory include html templates that will be rendered per request to a route. The templates are generally composed during runtime by the inclusion of a master layout and various blocks of the page included via separate partial files. The data that the view queries with the help of models is combined with templates by a templating engine and converted to plain HTML for the browser to render. Keystone.js supports various templating engines, each having its own syntax. We will look at Swig, a node.js templating engine in a future chapter.
