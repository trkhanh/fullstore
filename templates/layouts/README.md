The layouts directory will generally contain the master page that defines various blocks of the page where data can be injected before rendering. Each block has an identifying name. When partial templates are included with the master page, the identifying name is used by the templating engine to render the HTML appropriately. Pages can extend the master page to inherit the layout for a consistent appearance throughout the application.
